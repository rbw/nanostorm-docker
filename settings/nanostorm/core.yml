# There are two modes.
#
# - development:
#   * Enables a single-process built-in HTTP server (address customizable in `dev_address` directive)
#   * Enables auto-reload of project files
#   * Sets logging to `DEBUG` by default
#   * Sends logs to console by default
#
# - production:
#   * Multiprocess (customizable in `processes` directive)
#   * Binds to a unix socket specified in `unix_socket`, for use with a proxy (such as Nginx).
#   * Sets logging to `INFO` by default
#   * Sends logs to file by default
